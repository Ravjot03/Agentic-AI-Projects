# Agentic-AI-Projects

Welcome to my Agentic AI and Multimodal AI Agents repository! This repository showcases my work in building advanced AI agents with reasoning capabilities and the ability to process multiple modalities (text, images, audio, etc.). It includes concepts, models, and practical implementations of AI agents designed for various real-world applications.

1. [Multimodal AI Agent for Web Search & Stock Analysis](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Multimodal-AI-Agent)

This project demonstrates a multimodal AI agent setup that integrates different AI models and tools for web searching and stock analysis. The AI agents use the Groq model (powered by Llama-3.3-70b) to gather and analyze information from web search engines (DuckDuckGo) and financial data sources (Yahoo Finance) in a highly collaborative manner.
